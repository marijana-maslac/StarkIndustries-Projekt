			<p>Stark Industries is a weapons and technology company founded and owned by Howard Stark. In World War II, Stark Industries built 100,000 planes to help the Allied forces, quickly establishing them as a military contractor. Stark Industries also assisted the Strategic Scientific Reserve fight against HYDRA. After Howard's death, ownership passed to his son, Tony and the company was run by Obadiah Stane until Tony was old enough to take over. Under Tony's leadership, Stark Industries became the world leader in the development of manufacturing advanced weapons.</p>

			<p>Steve Rogers, Bucky Barnes and their respective dates, Bonnie and Connie, attended the Exposition. The Expo presented such inventions as Phineas Horton's Synthetic Man, and a prototype of a flying car by Stark Industries. Stark himself hosted the presentation of the flying car, an audience success despite the failure of the prototype.

			<h1>Stark Expo 1974</h1>
			<p>n 1974, Howard Stark presented the City of the Future at Stark Expo, but was limited with the technology of his time so he couldn't complete it.</p>

			<p>Knowing this, Howard left the blueprints of a new element he developed hidden in the model of the City of the Future, and made a recording for his son Tony Stark with clues so he could find the blueprints and complete his work. His plan worked, and Tony brought it back to try and pull the world together with technology for the future.

			<p>was originally Tony Stark's natural-language user interface computer system, named after Edwin Jarvis, the butler who worked for Howard Stark. Over time, he was upgraded into an artificially intelligent system, tasked with running business for Stark Industries as well as security for Tony Stark's Mansion and Stark Tower. After creating the Mark II armor, Stark uploaded J.A.R.V.I.S. into all of the Iron Man Armors, as well as allowing him to interact with the other Avengers, giving them valuable information during combat. During the Ultron Offensive, J.A.R.V.I.S. was destroyed by Ultron, although his remaining programming codes unknowingly continued to thwart Ultron's plans of gaining access to nuclear missiles. His remains were found by Stark, who uploaded them into a synthetic body made of vibranium and, in conjunction with Ultron's personality and an Infinity Stone, an entirely new being was made: Vision. J.A.R.V.I.S.' duties were then taken over by F.R.I.D.A.Y.

			<p>Vision is a synthezoid made from vibranium, created by Ultron with the help of Helen Cho, and given life by the powerful artifact known as the Mind Stone. Originally conceived as the perfect form for Ultron, the body was taken by the Avengers before Tony Stark and Bruce Banner proceeded to upload the remnants of Stark's personal A.I. J.A.R.V.I.S. into it. Upon his birth, Vision declared he was neither Ultron nor J.A.R.V.I.S., but one that would fight with them to protect humanity. Vision had then joined with the Avengers in the Battle of Sokovia, using his powers to prevent Ultron from transferring his consciousness to the internet, and allowing the Avengers to successfully put an end to his plan.
